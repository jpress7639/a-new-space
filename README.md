# A New Space
A New Space

 **Description:**
The goal of this app is to provide headspace for someone with the language of music and connect with other music listeners all over. The user can make an account where they will be able to listen to a radio station or playlist that is around their style of preference. They will also be able to customize their account, edit it, and delete it.

 # MVP:
 
**Sign In/Sign Up/Welcome** 
- A user will be able to create an account, be able to see the details of their account, and edit and delete with a created User API from MongoDB and produced by Heroku.

**Playlists**
- Using either a mock music database or an API from Spotify, we will able to showcase a few playlist based on the song data (either by genre or by year for this project's purposes)

**Main Menu** 
- dropdown menu with hamburger icon to access the different routes including to the main menu and the account settings


**Post MVP**
- Will come with a like button to add to a User's favorite songlist, saving songs to a favorite list
- working with a music API to actual present and play music with an adjustable volume button
- local storage
- CSS animation suggested by our UX team
